Dear <Title> <LastName>,

I am a rising second-year student at Notre Dame Law School, and I wish to be considered for a summer associate position with <FirmName> in San Francisco. Born and raised in the City, I intend to return to my home and family in San Francisco upon my graduation in May 2024. I am particularly interested in your firm’s antitrust and corporate practices, given my previous experience as a fiscal and policy analyst in government. In addition, I find the firm’s collaborative culture and commitment to social impact to be a perfect match with my professional interests. 

My background has prepared me to be a successful summer associate at your firm, particularly in your corporate practice groups. After graduating college, I worked as an analyst in government offices for six years, including the Mayor's Office of Public Policy and Finance. This experience allowed me to observe the interplay between public and private interests. Working in fast-paced executive offices also developed my abilities to write, communicate, and problem solve effectively as well as collaborate well in teams. In addition, my undergraduate studies in economics, government, and political theory have equipped me with a strong understanding of regulatory issues. I look forward to applying these skills and experiences as a summer associate at <FirmName>. 

I am very interested in joining <FirmName> as a summer associate and would be pleased to discuss my qualifications in an interview scheduled at your convenience. I am currently in San Francisco and would be able to meet in person until August 19. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely, 



Marie Lorraine M. Valdez`
